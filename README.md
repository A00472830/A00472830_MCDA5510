## Introduction
This C# Project traverses through the directories and parses the CSV Files. The parsed CSV files are then combined into a single CSV file and placed in a folder called Output.

## How to execute the Program?
- Start the program and provide the folder path (this program was written to work specifically on Windows) where the CSV files are placed.
