Hi, I am Princeton. I like all types of technology and geek out a lot about anything related to Space. I've been fond of computers since my childhood, and I have completed my undergrad in the field of Mechatronics Engineering. I have worked for two multinational IT companies till now, and I have gained 5.5 years of experience in API Development, especially with the product Axway API Gateway. Learning DevOps and Data Analytics are my current career enhancement goals.

## Summary of the topic that brought us together
The topic that brought us together is the programming language Python. We are fond of programming and have experience working with languages such as C++ and Java, among others. However, when compared to any other programming language, Python simply makes everything easier. From initialization, the syntax, the easy troubleshooting. Python is used in a wide range of technologies, and it is known for its ease of learning.
